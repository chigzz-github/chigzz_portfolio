<h4>Introduction</h4>
<ul>
<li>Analysis of COVID19 is the current trending topic for the people who are working in analysis domain</li>
<li>Keeping that in mind, we need to predict the new daily hospitalizations in New York City from COVID-19 from April 7 through April 16 (inclusive). Therefore, we are trying to predict the following HOSPITALIZED_COUNT as accurately as possible:</li>
</ul>

<h4>Dataset Description</h4>
<ul>
<li>The dataset of this analysis is taken from <a href="https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/case-hosp-death.csv" target="_blank" style="color:#0385F9"><u>Dataset Link</u></a></li>
<li>The target for predictions is the HOSPITALIZED_COUNT column in this dataset</li>
</ul>
The dataset is attached below:

<h4>Dataset Preparation</h4>
<ul>
<li>(logN+1) normalization is used in the dataset. Log transformations are used to transform skewed data to approximately confirm to normality. Many of our data points are 0 because many of the death cases were 0 at the start. For a quick fix, we added 1 to each data point</li>
<li>train_df dataset is made for the dates below "2020-04-07". This is further divided into training and test dataset</li>
<li>Target split dataset is performed for considering the dates from April 7th to April 17 which is used for predictions</li>
<li>Transformed data for CASE_COUNT,DEATH_COUNT,HOSPITALIZED_COUNT is as below:</li>
</ul>

<h4>Modelling Techniques</h4>
<ul>
<li>Generalized Linear Model (GLM) is used to predict the hospitalization count. . It usually refers to conventional linear regression models for a continuous response variable.t</li>
<li>Ordinary Least Square (OLS) is used to predict the hospitalization count. OLS regression is a statistical method of analysis that estimates the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Results</h4>
<ul>
<li>The MAPE score of GLM Model is 2.245. This means that our model has approximately 2% error.</li>
<li>The MAPE score of OLS Model is 1.47. This means that our model has approximately 1% error</li>
<li>Visualization for the best model is as below:</li>
