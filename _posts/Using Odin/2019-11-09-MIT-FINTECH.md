<h4>Introduction</h4>
<ul style= "font-weight:normal">
<li>Spoofing is the activity of entering trading orders with no intention to actually trade; to manipulate the market price. This is often done to benefit a traders current positions and increase their PnL. This is a BIG PROBLEM. It carries financial and reputational risk, and is strictly prohibited by all major financial regulators.
Nevertheless, companies like Citi execute millions of trade orders every day, and it is impossible to track, observe and analyze every single trading order that is made</li>
<li>The The detailed problem statement can be find from the beside link <a href="https://github.com/chigzz-github/MIT-Fintech-Challenge/blob/master/2020%20MIT%20Hack%20Citi.pptx" target="_blank" style="color:#0385F9"><u>Problem Statement</u></a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Challenge</h4>
<p style= "font-weight:normal">To identify the Spoofing in large sets of trading data. CITI Bank provided the sample data and pandas dataframe with a simple model. Use this for your analysis – we will assess your accuracy on test data in the same format.</p>
 
<h4>Deliverables</h4>
<ol>
<li>A model identifying “Top of Book” spoofing</li>
<li>A model identifying 2 other types of spoofing hidden in the data</li>
<li>A graphical interface, UI, or set of charts that show your results (real-time or historical)</li>
</ol>
